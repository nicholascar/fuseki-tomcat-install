# fuseki-tomcat-install
This tiny repo holds instructions for installing Apache's Jena Fuseki RDF triplestore web API on a Linux server running Tomcat.  

It's basically an extension to the instructions at Fuseki's documentation pages at <https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/>.  

## Installation script
The installation script is <install.sh>. It's not quite ready for automated installation so should be followed "by hand".
